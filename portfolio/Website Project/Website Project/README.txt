Our goal was to give people an easy, but fun game to play. We wanted it to be entertaining, so we made custom music that goes with the game. 
If you follow the beat, you get a higher score. We wanted to give a global high scores page, so you could compare yourself to everyone else who played the game.
With a login and register page, we give players a way to protect their account and feel like a legitamate site.

We had a lot of fun making this game, and we hope you enjoy it too.
